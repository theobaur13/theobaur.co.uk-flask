# theobaur.co.uk-flask

This was orginally created as a flask port for my legacy personal website [theobaur.co.uk](https://github.com/theobaur13/theobaur.co.uk/).

## About
My evolving personal website source code.

This is a Flask web-application deployed using _Apache2_ designed to showcase my current and upcoming projects and photos. This website uses my own custom CSS stylesheet and JavaScript to display animations. Feel free to use any part of this website for personal or public use.

## Live Site
The live website can be found at [theobaur.co.uk](https://theobaur.co.uk).

## Legacy Site
Feel free to explore or fork this code for personal use. Keep in mind this version may be outdated compared to the live version.
You can explore my old site at [theobaur-legacy.netlify.app](https://theobaur-legacy.netlify.app/)
