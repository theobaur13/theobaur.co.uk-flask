            "description": "ESOTERIC is a tool that uses natural language processing to automatically retrieve and verify evidence for a given input claim. It is designed to assist fact-checkers and journalists in verifying claims made in news articles and other sources. ESOTERIC uses the FEVER dataset (Fact Extraction and VERification) as its source of information. It uses a multitude of different language models to perform various NLP tasks and even fine-tunes models to improve performance. It is wrapped in a Flask website that allows users to input a claim and view the evidence retrieved by the tool. ESOTERIC was my final year individual project for my degree in BSc Computer Science at Cardiff University and was awarded a grade of 84%.",
