            "description": "In November 2024 I travelled up to Edinburgh to take part in an assessment center during my graduate job hunt. As the train journey up to Scotland was so long (around 7 hours), I decided to stay for a couple of nights to explore the city. I visited Dean Village, Edinburgh Castle, the Royal Mile, Dalton Hill, and had a wander around the city center."
